We provide Point Cloud Scans to BIM 3D model services. We use state-of-the-art
software to convert point cloud and laser scanning survey data into millimeter
accurate 3D models for architects, retailers, surveyors and contractors.

Laser Scanners identify a building’s current conditions and create point cloud
information. Point clouds include precise and large amounts of data that can be
created into precise 3D models. Our point cloud to BIM modeling service creates
accurate models for as-built purposes as well as for retrofit and renovation
projects.

Our 3D BIM models are primarily created using Revit. The raw survey data is
compiled from supplied point clouds and images using our Point Cloud to 3D
Modeling process. We can also use the raw survey data and images from laser
survey tools within a range of different software tools to create accurate
architectural, structural, and MEP models to depict the existing conditions.
